#####PSA: 

In general, good practice is for only one person to manage the master branch, no one else.  If this person isn't you, and the change you want to make will take more than one commit, you should make a new branch, make the change, commit and push it, then make a pull request for the master branch to pull in your changes.

This way, master will always be a working version, and if something breaks, then it's easier to see where this happened, and changes are more easily tracked and organized.
